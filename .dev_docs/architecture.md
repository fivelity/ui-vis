# UI-Vis Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the UI-Vis application, providing an overview of the main components, data flow, and design patterns.

## Application Structure

UI-Vis follows a modular architecture based on Next.js 14 and the App Router pattern:

```
ui-vis/
├── public/              # Static assets
├── src/
│   ├── app/             # App router pages
│   ├── components/      # Reusable UI components
│   ├── lib/             # Core utilities and business logic
│   │   ├── ai/          # AI integration services
│   │   ├── types/       # TypeScript type definitions
│   │   └── utils/       # Shared utility functions
│   └── modules/         # Feature-specific modules
│       ├── ai-processing/   # AI analysis components
│       └── file-generation/ # Code generation components
├── .dev_docs/           # Development documentation
└── AI_INTEGRATION.md    # AI-specific documentation
```

## Core Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - UI components are separated from business logic
   - AI services are abstracted away from UI components
   - Type definitions are centralized for consistency

2. **Type Safety**
   - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
   - Strict type checking enabled throughout the application
   - Zod validation for runtime type checking

3. **Component Architecture**
   - Self-contained, reusable UI components
   - Clear props interfaces with proper documentation
   - Accessibility built-in to all components

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**
   - User provides design inputs (image/text)
   - Input is validated client-side

2. **AI Processing**
   - AI service processes the input
   - Results are transformed into structured data

3. **UI Rendering**
   - Generated files/analysis displayed to user
   - Interactive components allow modifications

4. **File Generation**
   - User can generate, download, or copy files
   - Results can be persisted to local storage

## AI Integration Architecture

The AI integration follows a layered approach:

1. **Provider Layer** (`providers.ts`)
   - Handles provider-specific initialization
   - Manages credentials and configuration

2. **Utility Layer** (`utils.ts`)
   - Provides shared functionality
   - Handles image processing and formatting

3. **Service Layer** (`services.ts`)
   - Exposes high-level API for components
   - Orchestrates the AI processing workflow

4. **UI Layer** (`AIProcessor.tsx`, `FileGenerator.tsx`)
   - Presents user interface for interaction
   - Manages state and user feedback

## State Management

- React's built-in state hooks for component-level state
- Context API for cross-component state when needed
- Local storage for persisting user preferences and results

## Performance Optimization

- Efficient rendering with React.memo for expensive components
- Code-splitting for large dependencies
- Caching of AI responses to minimize API calls
- Streaming responses for large AI outputs

## Error Handling

- Comprehensive error handling at all levels
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Detailed logging for debugging
