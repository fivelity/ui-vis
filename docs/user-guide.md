# UI-Vis User Guide

This comprehensive guide will help you navigate the UI-Vis platform and get the most out of its AI-powered design-to-code capabilities.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection for cloud AI providers (OpenAI, TogetherAI)
- Local hardware with sufficient resources if using Ollama locally

### Account Setup

1. Visit the UI-Vis application at your deployment URL or localhost
2. No account is required for local usage
3. For saved projects, create an account or sign in with your preferred authentication method

## Interface Overview

UI-Vis features a clean, intuitive interface organized into several key areas:

### Main Dashboard

- Project history and recent files
- Quick start templates
- Settings and preferences

### Generation Wizard

The core feature of UI-Vis follows a step-by-step process:

1. **Input**: Provide your design (image upload or text description)
2. **Configuration**: Select AI provider, model, and output preferences
3. **Analysis**: Review the AI's understanding of your design
4. **Generation**: View the code generation progress
5. **Preview**: Interact with the generated interface
6. **Export**: Download or save your project

## Using UI-Vis

### 1. Providing Design Input

#### Image Upload

For best results with image uploads:
- Use clear, high-resolution images
- Crop to focus on the UI elements
- Prefer PNG or high-quality JPG formats
- Remove unnecessary background elements

To upload an image:
1. Click the "Upload Image" button or drag and drop
2. Optionally add supplementary text to clarify aspects of the design
3. Proceed to configuration

#### Text Description

When using text descriptions:
- Be specific about layout and component relationships
- Describe visual styling (colors, typography, spacing)
- Mention interactive elements and their behavior
- Reference familiar UI patterns when applicable

Example of a good text description:
```
A modern landing page with a dark blue (#1a2b3c) header containing a white logo on the left and 
navigation menu on the right with 4 items. Below is a hero section with a large headline "Transform 
Your Ideas" on the left and a form with name, email fields and a yellow submit button on the right.
The page uses Roboto font and has a minimalist design with ample whitespace.
```

### 2. Configuring Your Project

#### AI Provider Selection

Choose from available providers based on your needs:
- **OpenAI**: Best quality, higher cost
- **TogetherAI**: Good balance of quality and cost
- **Ollama**: Free, local processing, variable quality based on model

#### Model Selection

Different models offer varying capabilities:
- **Large models** (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 70B): Best for complex designs
- **Medium models** (GPT-3.5, Mistral 7B): Good for most common designs
- **Small models** (Llama 7B, Phi-2): Fastest but less detailed output

#### Output Configuration

Customize your generated code:
- **Framework**: React, Vue, vanilla JS
- **Styling**: Tailwind, CSS Modules, vanilla CSS
- **Complexity**: Simple prototype vs. production-ready
- **Accessibility**: Standard vs. enhanced a11y features
- **Responsive**: Desktop-first vs. mobile-first

### 3. Reviewing Analysis

The Analysis step shows:
- Component identification and hierarchy
- Layout structure detection
- Style analysis (colors, typography, spacing)
- Confidence scores for detected elements

Tips for analysis review:
- Check that all major components are identified
- Verify that layout relationships are correctly understood
- Confirm any special requirements are noted

### 4. Generating Code

During generation:
- Monitor progress indicators for each file
- View real-time logs of the generation process
- Wait for all files to complete generation
- Review any warnings or suggestions

### 5. Using the Preview

The preview environment allows you to:
- Interact with your generated UI
- Test responsive behavior with different viewports
- Inspect elements and their properties
- Make adjustments to styling in real-time

### 6. Exporting Your Project

Export options include:
- Complete project download (ZIP file)
- Individual file download
- Copy code to clipboard
- Save to project history

## Advanced Features

### Custom Templates

Create and save templates for:
- Styling preferences
- Component structures
- Framework configurations
- Design patterns

### Project History

UI-Vis maintains a history of your generated projects:
- Access previous generations
- Compare different versions
- Apply settings from past projects

### API Integration

For developers, UI-Vis offers an API for:
- Batch processing multiple designs
- Integration with design tools
- Custom workflow automation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Generation Failures

If generation fails:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify API keys are valid
3. Try a different model or provider
4. Simplify your design input

#### Visual Discrepancies

If the generated UI doesn't match your design:
1. Provide more detailed input
2. Check that all elements are visible in your image
3. Use supplementary text to clarify ambiguous elements
4. Try a more powerful model

#### Performance Issues

If experiencing slow performance:
1. Use a smaller model for faster results
2. Optimize image size before uploading
3. Close other resource-intensive applications
4. Check your system resources if using Ollama locally

## Best Practices

### For Best Results

1. **Clear Inputs**: Provide high-quality images or detailed text descriptions
2. **Appropriate Models**: Use larger models for complex designs
3. **Iterative Approach**: Start simple and refine gradually
4. **Supplementary Details**: Provide additional context about special requirements
5. **Framework Matching**: Choose frameworks you're familiar with for easier customization

### Optimizing Workflow

1. **Templates**: Save configurations for similar projects
2. **Component Focus**: Generate complex components individually for better results
3. **Combine Outputs**: Mix and match generated components
4. **Post-Generation Editing**: Expect to make some adjustments to generated code
