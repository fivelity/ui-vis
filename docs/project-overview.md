# UI-Vis Project Overview

UI-Vis is an innovative design-to-code conversion platform that uses AI to transform UI designs into production-ready code. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project, its capabilities, architecture, and integration points.

## üöÄ What is UI-Vis?

UI-Vis bridges the gap between design and development by allowing users to upload UI designs (images or text descriptions) and generating functional, accessible, and production-ready code. The platform leverages multiple AI providers to analyze designs and produce high-quality implementations.

### Key Features

- **Multi-modal Input**: Accept image files or detailed text descriptions
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Intelligent breakdown of design elements, layout, and component structure
- **Code Generation**: Production-ready code with proper styling and accessibility standards
- **Multiple AI Provider Support**: Integration with OpenAI, TogetherAI, and Ollama
- **Customizable Output**: Control over generated code style, complexity, and frameworks
- **Visual Previews**: Real-time visualization of generated interfaces
- **Export Options**: Download as complete project or individual files

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

UI-Vis is built with a modern tech stack designed for performance, extensibility, and developer experience:

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Next.js with React 18+ for component-based architecture
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth, accessible animations
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend

- **API Routes**: Next.js API routes for serverless functions
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for secure user authentication
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQL database
- **File Storage**: Local storage or cloud provider (configurable)

### AI Integration

- **Providers**: OpenAI, TogetherAI, Ollama (locally-run models)
- **Integration**: Vercel AI SDK for unified provider interface
- **Visual Analysis**: Processing of design images for structural analysis
- **Code Generation**: Specialized prompting for different output formats

## üîÑ Workflow Overview

### 1. Input Collection

Users provide design input through:
- Image upload (PNG, JPG, SVG)
- Text description
- URL to design

### 2. Design Analysis

The AI analyzes the design to identify:
- Layout structure
- Component hierarchy
- UI elements and their relationships
- Colors, typography, and spacing
- Interactive elements

### 3. Configuration

Users can customize:
- Output framework/library
- Styling approach
- Code complexity
- Accessibility requirements
- AI provider and model

### 4. Code Generation

The system generates:
- HTML structure
- CSS/styling code
- JavaScript functionality
- Component files
- Asset references

### 5. Preview and Export

Users can:
- View real-time preview
- Edit generated code
- Download as complete project
- Export individual files
- Save to project history

## üß© Components and Structure

UI-Vis follows a modular component architecture for maintainability and extensibility:

### Core Modules

- **Design Input Processor**: Handles and normalizes different input types
- **AI Service Layer**: Manages communication with AI providers
- **Code Generation Engine**: Converts AI analysis to structured code
- **Preview Renderer**: Creates visual representation of generated code
- **Export Service**: Packages code for different output formats

### Key Components

- **Wizard Interface**: Step-by-step generation flow
- **ProviderSelector**: AI provider configuration
- **CodeEditor**: Interactive code viewing and editing
- **PreviewPane**: Real-time visualization
- **ExportOptions**: Output format selection

## üîå Integration Points

UI-Vis provides several integration options for extending functionality:

### API Endpoints

- `/api/analyze`: Submit design for analysis
- `/api/generate`: Generate code from analysis
- `/api/export`: Package and download generated code

### AI Provider Extension

- Provider adapter interface for adding new AI services
- Configuration schema for provider-specific settings
- Response normalization utilities

### Output Formats

- React components
- Vue components
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Next.js pages
- CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.)
